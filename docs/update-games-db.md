# Updating the Teambuilding Games Database

The single source of truth for https://alele.io is not the database but the [aleleio teambuilding-games repository](https://github.com/aleleio/teambuilding-games).

To update the games, please fork that repository and create a pull request.

To apply the update to aleleio's database, use the [import script](../tools/import_to_database.py) in [tools/](../tools).
