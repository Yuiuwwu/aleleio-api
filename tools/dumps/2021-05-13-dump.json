On \"Alele!\" you joyfully raise it up in the air, and show it to everyone on \"Alele Kita Bonga!\" not believing how lucky you are! On \"A massa massa massa\" you eat the imaginary tiny watermelon, and praise whatever higher being has presented you with this gift with \"Eee aeeou-wee...\".\n\nOn the next repetition, the watermelon has gotten bigger! It is now the size of an actual watermelon. Use both hands. The joy!\n\nOn the next repetition, the watermelon has gotten even bigger! It is now the size of a car tyre. Your shouts of praise grow louder as you struggle under the weight!\n\nOn the next repetition, the watermelon has gotten so big you collapse and fall to the ground (and everyone else with you)! You shout at the top of your voice as you bounce up and down to bite from it. This is peak watermelon. The song is over."

At different meetings, a question is selected and brought out to the group at the beginning of the meeting (or at some other point) and the slips\npassed out. Each person with a slip must find the individual who wrote it, only if that person is present of course. This causes a nice mixing of the group and allows for a humorous re-introduction of the group members to one another. Later in the meeting, have people disclose their response to the group. This can provide for an energizing break to a meeting."

The two participants alongside form a circle with their hands and place them on the side of the participant pointed to serve as \"ears\" of the elephant.\n\n\"Jello\" - Participant shakes his or her body like jello continuously. The two participants alongside hold each other's hands and form a circle around the target participant. The idea is to form a \"glass\" around the jello.\n\n\"Queen Bee\" - Participant turns around and puts his or her hands together behind the back (just above the buttocks) and flutters them back and forth to mimic a bee's tail. The two participants alongside thrust their arms away from the bee and flutter them like wings.\n\n\"Donkey\" - participant and those alongside him or her should freeze and not move at all\n\nExpect that people will be confused and make mistakes.

The guesser goes out of the circle and walks about 10-15 metres away (or goes behind a wall or tree if available.) The guesser then closes his or her eyes.\n\nThe idea is for the guesser to be unable to see what the rest of the circle is doing or to hear what they are saying. Among the rest of the circle, a delegate volunteers or is chosen to lead the group. The leader then begins making a motion and everyone else copies it. They do so, using any part of their body. Someone then yells to the guesser that the group is ready.\n\nThe guesser comes back and stands in the middle of the circle. The object is for the guesser to guess who the leader is. The leader can change the motion, and everyone else follows. It works best if not everyone looks at the leader. The guesser gets three guesses to guess who the leader is. If he/she guesses correctly, the person who started the motion is the one who is removed from the space for the next round.\n\nAfter a third incorrect guess, the leader reveals him or her."

When they do the player that said 'zip' and was pointing at them must change direction of the pointing. This means that they must quickly turn around, point and say 'zip' to the person that just pointed at them. Now the 'zip' can zip around the circle, but changing direction every time there is a 'zap'. Lastly the person that receives the 'zip' may elect to yell 'zop' and point at someone anywhere in the circle. That player then restarts the 'zip' going in the direction of their choice."

He attacks by slapping the hand of another player who is allowed to react only in the last moment.\n\nIf he hits the hand, this player loses the hand (it goes on the back) and only has one life remaining (e.g. his other hand). After a successful hit, it's the attacking player's turn again.\n\nIf he misses, he needs to freeze and its immediately the attacked player's turn, who can as well either retaliate (often going into back-and-forth battles) or make a step away.\n\nIf a player chooses to move instead of attack, he calls the name of another player immediately afterwards.

You then invite one of the persons that have already been blindfolded to come in with his/her hands behind him. It must stay behind him as long as he/she is approaching the king. They are asked to bow before the king in respect (keeping hands behind). Take them very close to the king where they can actually kneel right in front of the toe that has the mayonnaise or Vaseline on it. They bow as to kiss the king ring and the king puts his finger out so that the person kisses the finger instead of the toe. The king then puts his hand behind him leaving the toe as the visible object that has been kissed. The blindfold is now taken off and the person sees the toe and thinks that he/she has kissed this ugly toe. (Make sure that you keep adding more Vaseline to the finger as it will be kissed off, also make sure that enough is on the toe) Continue with the next person until all have come in. Do not tell the person what has happened but encourage the person to watch and see what has happened. He/she will laugh at himself. The other players must be locked away so that they have no clue as to what is happening, they will hear the laughs and will be curious and anxious to come in.

Have the twos take a step forward and turn around and face someone on the outside circle so there are 2 circles facing each other. The inside circle is where the Birdies are and the outside circle are the Perches and the person opposite you is your Perch or Birdie.\n\nTo perch, the Birdie must use their Perch (e.g. be lifted up/climb them) to avoid any contact with the ground. The group leader will provide music and as the music plays the two circles rotate in opposite directions. The group leader yells \"Birdie on a Perch!\" at random and the birdies must scramble to find their perches. The last couple to successfully perch is out until a single couple is left."
